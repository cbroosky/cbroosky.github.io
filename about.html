		<h1>My Life: The Short(ish) Story</h1>
		<hr><br><br>
		<article>
			<p> I grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where I learned many moral and leadership
				lessons through different leadership positions. There, I was also taught the importance of service for
				others. I joined Boy Scouts when I was 12. By the time I was 14 I had put in enough work and time to get
				my Eagle Scout, a very important moment in my life, because without it, I would not be the person I am
				today. When I was about 6 years old I wanted to wrestle; I joined our local little guy wrestling team
				and started to train. I wrestled until the end of 8th grade. During that time I learned how much effect
				hard work, dedication, discipline, and refusing to quit can have on the outcome of every aspect or
				challenge in life. There were a few principles that I was taught and still use to this day; work hard
				and give everything 110% effort, be the aggressor, and never quit. I apply these principles in every
				aspect of my life, I have to give everything my everything. </p>
			<p> When I was in 6th grade I was introduced to my local robotics club. I had always excelled in school but
				wasn't ever challenged. This was a way that I could challenge myself in ways I would never have guessed.
				I was put on a team with three other kids my age and it was decided that I would do all the programming
				for the team. I had a mountain to navigate just to get started on my programming journey. I went from no
				experience to competing in the finals match at the state competition with a decent autonomous program
				and a big smile on my face. This was when I knew I was going to pour my heart and soul into learning
				everything I could about programming. </p>
			<p> The summer after my freshman year I was going to flip burgers for 10 bucks an hour, when my robotics
				mentor reached out to me and said he would hire me as his personal developer for the same pay. That same
				year I was reached out to by another robotics mentor and asked to beta-test their warehouse sprinkler
				application. I had no clue what I was doing, I didn't know any language well enough to say I was fluent
				in it, and I had no idea where to start either. I began scouring the internet for every resource I could
				find to aid in the process of learning these new languages (Dart, C++, and Python). I would stay up late
				watching tutorials, reading books, and attempting to make my own programs. By the end of the summer I
				had taken in so much information that I was confident in my abilities. I started to come up with my own
				ideas, including an automated hot chocolate maker. Yet when I started to put my idea into code, I
				realized that I didn't know a lick of practical programming. </p>
			<p> So I began the process of learning about servers and clients, cyber security, API's, and databases. I
				even made a personal home server that hosted my own website that could show images, play videos, and
				create and store password protected users. But, unfortunately, that learning had been delayed by
				Covid-19. For the first semester of my sophomore year I, like many students across the country, had a
				virtual learning environment. I thought I would take advantage of the situation and take honors courses
				and even an extra class on top of everything else. Through that long semester, I found that I struggled
				in that environment. I didn't pick up topics as well and I was sitting at my desk from 7am until 9pm
				Monday through Sunday. I was burnt out by January. I started to doubt myself and my capabilities, I
				began to lose focus of my college dreams. I was able to go to brick-and-mortar school for the second
				semester and began to remember my goals. I started to push myself to learn as much about programming as
				I could. </p>
			<p> My Junior year I decided I would compete in BPA in their programming events. I took first in all of my
				events regionally(Python and Java programming, programming concepts, and interview skills), I placed
				2nd, 5th, 1st, and 7th respectively at state and 8th and 10th in Python and Java respectively at the
				national level. I had no clue what I was getting into, I couldn't write a program in Java that could
				simply read a text file. By the end of the year I was reading formatted files and saving information
				generated by the user. Robotics got me moving in a direction I might never have found had I not joined.
				Without robotics I wouldn't have competed in BPA, or worked as a programmer, or decide Computer Science
				as a major. Robotics has given me limitless potential! </p>
