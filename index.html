				<p>I am a senior currently attending Simms High School. I was born in Billings, MT in 2005. We moved to
					Vaughn, MT when I was one. From there I went to Vaughn Elementary School for my elementary and
					junior high education. I wrestled from 1st grade until 8th grade. It was my favorite sport by far.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>In 6th grade a friend of mine introduced me to our local robotics team. Before I was introduced to
					robotics I had never really been intellectually challenged in my life. Math and science was a
					breeze, and I could write well written essays. After being introduced to robotics I found that it
					challenged me, in way I hadn't been challenged before. </p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I have been actively participating on the team since. The year I joined I went from zero to finalist
					at the state competition with a decent autonomous, that is when I knew I was going to spend the rest
					of my life pursuing this field. That same year our sister team won the World Championship in
					Houston! My freshman year I was going to go flip burgers for $10/hr, my robotics mentor caught wind
					of this and offered me the same pay but programming instead of burgers. Since then I have learned an
					unfathomable amount of knowledge from that job.
