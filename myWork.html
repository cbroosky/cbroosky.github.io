					Volleyball Statistic Tracker
				</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					I am the volleyball manager for my highschool, and when I was doing stats I found that I disliked the
					program they used. So I decided I would make my own. It is still a work in progress and has yet to
					be battle tested, but it seems to do most of its job. Here is the Github link!

				<h3>
					Automated Hot Cocoa Maker
				</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					I have to get up at 5:30 every morning and I enjoy a cup of cocoa, I hate making it though. By the
					time I am ready to go, I don't have any time left to make hot chocolate. So I had the idea to make
					an automated hot chocolate maker. The idea is that I can press a button the night before telling it
					I want cocoa in the morning. It will then, at a set time fire up and make a nice pot of cocoa. I
					haven't had too much time to work on the code, but it will also interface through my home automation
					server.
